# Linear Regression
- Regression: It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable. like the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.
- Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- When there is only one independent feature, it is known as Simple Linear Regression, and when there are more than one feature, it is known as Multiple Linear Regression.
## Problem Statement:
The Advertising dataset captures sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement spends across multiple channels like radio, tv, and newspaper

## Objective:
Build a linear regression model to:

- Interpret the coefficients of the model
- make predictions
- find and analyze model residuals
- evaluate model efficiency using RMSE and R-Square values

Here are some of the questions which can reveal information from the data:

- is there a relationship between ads and sales?
- if so, how strong is that relationship?
- what types of ads contribute to sales?
- what is the effect each ad type has on sales?
- given ad spending, can sales be predicted?
